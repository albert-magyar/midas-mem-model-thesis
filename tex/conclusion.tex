While FPGA-accelerated simulation is not yet a standard technique for
computer architecture researchers, it appears to be the only path for
obtaining the fast and accurate full-system models required to
investigate many future computing applications and platforms.  The
advent of cloud-hosted FPGA-enhanced server instances significantly
reduces the barrier for researchers to begin using FPGA-accelerated
simulation, but productive development of full-system FPGA simulations
is still a challenge.  In this paper, we present some approaches to
improve productivity.  Automatically deriving cycle-exact, bit-exact
FPGA models from synthesizable target RTL modules reduces
model-building and validation effort and enables researchers to also
observe cycle-time, area, and power impacts using commercial ECAD
tools.  As not all components are readily mapped from RTL into an FPGA
model, we also develop parameterized generators to produce
configurable models for these components.  Combining these two forms
of module provides a highly productive environment for performing
complex computer architecture research, as shown by the detailed
results obtained for garbage collection in a managed-language runtime.
