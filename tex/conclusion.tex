FPGAs in the cloud provide a compelling platform to build fast, detailed
full-system simulators. However, if FPGA-accelerated simulation is to see wider
adoption, the usability limitations of prior work must be addressed.  One
promising avenue lies in automatically deriving cycle-exact, bit-exact FPGA
models from synthesizable target RTL modules. This reduces model-building and
validation effort while enabling researchers to also observe cycle-time, area,
and power impacts using commercial ECAD tools.

\PNAME addresses a longstanding hole in these RTL-transforming approaches by
providing models of outer cache hierarchies and DRAM memory systems---components
of the target design that cannot be naively transformed from ASIC
RTL.  However, by applying the same transformation on a target-time
timing-model, \PNAME obviates many of the pitfalls of handwriting FPGA-hosted
models, as it separates the concerns target-behavior modeling and
host-platform mapping. As a result, \PNAME instances are both fast---capable
of running at the host frequency---and detailed---comparable to
cycle-accurate software simulators of DRAM---while being far less onerous
to implement.
