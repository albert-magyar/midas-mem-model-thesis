Recent work in FPGA-accelerated simulation of ASICs has shown that much
of a simulator can be automatically generated from ASIC RTL.  Alas, these works rely on simple models of
the outer cache hierarchy and DRAM, as
mapping ASIC RTL for these components into an FPGA fabric is too
complex and resource intensive.  To improve FPGA simulation model
accuracy, we present \PNAME, a
parameterized generator of composable, high-fidelity, FPGA-hosted
last-level-cache and DRAM models. \PNAME instances are highly
performant, yet they maintain timing faithfulness independently of the
behavior of the host-FPGA memory system.
For a given scheduling policy, a single \PNAME instance can model
nearly the entire space of realizable single-channel DDR3 memory
organizations, without resynthesizing the simulator RTL.
We demonstrate \PNAME by integrating it into a flow that automatically
transforms RTL for multicore RISC-V processors into full-system
simulators that execute at up to 150 target MHz on cloud-hosted FPGAs.
